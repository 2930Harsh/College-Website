            <p style="font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">
                The first Prime Minister of independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru, sought to develop India as a leader in
                science and technology. Between 1959 and 1965, with this vision, the Government founded 14 educational
                institutions in different regions of India. The system of competitive entry (based on merit) gave access
                to
                higher education in these institutions. Such an institution was established in 1963 in Kurukshetra as a
                joint enterprise of the Government of India and the Government of Punjab, India as the Regional
                Engineering
                College, Kurukshetra (REC Kurukshetra). In 2002, all the Regional Engineering Colleges were unified by a
                common entrance exam. Therefore, REC Kurukshetra was renamed to National Institute of Technology under
                the
                NIT Act and was given a Deemed University status.
